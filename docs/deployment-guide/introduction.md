In Kata Platform 3.0, bot deployment has been renewed. Through our extensive user research, we found that users need to have a separate “place” for them to develop chatbot, client demo/review, and live/public version. These 3 environments are crucial in ensuring the success of every chatbot development cycle. In Kata Platform 3.0, now you have 3 separate environments in every project: Development, Staging, and Production.

Furthermore, we also included a “rollback” feature in this new deployment concept. Rollback is a term that is similar to “revert” in Git. Rollback feature allows you to restore previous versions of bot, NLU, and CMS.
