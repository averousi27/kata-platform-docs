## Bot Anatomy

A bot is uniquely defined by botId and its version. We adopt semantic versioning (semver) for the bot versioning scheme. A bot consists of:

- Flow Definitions
- Configuration
- NLUs
- Methods

## Bot Management

Our Bot management also maintain the versioning of the bots. You can have multiple versions of a bot and you will be able to revert back to any previous versions. You can also tag a version with a specific label.

## CLI Commands

You can use the CLI to manage your bot. To push a bot to Kata Platform Cloud, you can use following command in the folder where you have the bot.yml:

```
kata push
```

Please note that the system doesn't allow pushing to an existing version. So when you want to update the version number, you need to use --rev patch/minor/major:

```
kata push --rev patch
```

To get list of your bot versions:

```
kata versions
```

To get list of your bots:

```
kata list-bots
```
